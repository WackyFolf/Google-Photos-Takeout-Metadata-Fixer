# Google Photos Takeout Metadata Fixer

Note: Someone already did this, use [this](https://github.com/mattwilson1024/google-photos-exif) instead, it's better

## About
 Google Photos exports images with corresponding JSON files including metadata. Google Photos includes the metadata in the photos themselves, but it oftentimes fails to include important information like the date taken. This applies (some of) the information from the JSONs to the images.
## Requirements
<ul><li>Python 3</li>
<li>exif (Python library)</li></ul>
